# 3D Models for FluidGlass Component

This directory should contain the following 3D model files:

- `lens.glb` - Cylindrical lens model for the lens mode
- `bar.glb` - Bar/rectangular model for the bar mode
- `cube.glb` - Cube model for the cube mode

## Where to get the models:

You can download example models from the react-bits repository or create your own in Blender:
https://github.com/react-bits/FluidGlass

## Quick Fix:
If you don't have the models yet, you can use placeholder geometry by modifying the FluidGlass component to use primitive shapes until you add the actual .glb files.
